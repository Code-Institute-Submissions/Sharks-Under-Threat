    <p class="content">Even though sharks are feared by many people on average only 10 people per year die to shark attack. In comparrison humans cause over 100 million shark deaths on
      average over a year. These massive numbers are cause both directley by humans hoping to make money from selling shark products, also indirectley by the way we
  all live our lives unknowing the effect we have on the oceans as a whole and massive effect on the lives of these beautiful and mis-understood creatures </p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Pollution</h2>
      <p class="content">Marine pollution can be anything from dangerous chemicals such as fuel,oil and fetilisters to garbage such as plastic bottles,
        old cars and even food waste.
        Chemicals like fertilisers run off from farms to the ocean and tend to accumilate at the ends of rivers.
        In these areas alge grows rappidley blocking out the sun rays and starving the water below of oxygen and nutrients creating dead zones.
        Oil spills are massivley harmful to all marine life poisioning all life it touches meaning the whole foodchain is effected. The oil also
        clings all life causing external dammage such as fin and scale erosion, blocking marine mammal blow holes and subjecting furred marine mammals
        such as otters to hypothermia. With sharks at the top of the food chain all these issues have massive effects on thier ability to survive.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Overfishing</h2>
      <p class="content">Overfishing is the removal of a species of fish from the water faster than they can replenish thier numbers, this results in the species becoming
        scarce and underpopulated in that area. It is estimated that over one third of fish stocks have been overfished and will not be able to recover 
       if we countine to consume fish and fish products at the rate we are. The massive change in the population of fish species can have a massive effect
       on the eco system causing loss of habitat, genetic diversity and sustanaible food sources for both other marine creatures and humans.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Single Use Plastic</h2>
      <p class="content">Single use plastics are so common in every corner of the globe.Be it plastic bags, straws or bottles they are everywhere and when we are done with them
        we throw them away. The problem is that eventually everything finds it way back to the ocean. Either through weather or bad waste management by goverments
        or communites. These plastic items take hundreds of years to break down and have massive effects on the marine enviroment. Many larger objects get caught
        in airways or get wrapped around fish, birds and even whales and sharks. The smaller items break down into micro plastics and are consumed by the smallest
        creatures in the food chain which then accumilate to the larger predators and eventually to humans in the fish we eat. This has a large effect on sharks as
        they consume large ammounts of prey to survive and therfore have the largest ammount of build of the toxins in the pastics causing massive dammage to the sharks
        and dramatically reducing thier numbers.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Finning</h2>
      <p class="content">Shark finning is the removal of the fins of a shark to profit from the products made from the fins and discard with the rest of the shark throwing it back into
        the ocean while it is still alive. As sharks need to move to be able to breath they are left to suffocate at the ocean floor. Considired one of the biggest threats
        to shark population the fins are used as the main ingedient in shakr fin soup and used in untested herbal remidies in some countys. Roughley 70-100 million sharks 
        are killed each year for thier fins and is mostley un-regulated with many endangered species such as the scalloped hammerhead especially under threat.</p>
