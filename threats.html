    <h2 class="page-title-two-black">Sharks are under attack!</h2>
    <p class="content">Although sharks are feared by many people, an average of only ten people die each year due to shark attacks. 
      In comparison, humans are responsible for over 100 million shark deaths annually. These huge numbers are caused both directly and indirectly; 
      directly by humans hunting, killing and selling shark products for money, and indirectly by human's unknowingly contributing to the polluting
       and destruction of shark habitats. </p>

    <div class="col-lg-5 threats-image-one" alt="Marine Pollution"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-7 threats-content">
      <h2 class="section-title-two">Pollution</h2>
      <p class="content">Marine pollution is a combination of dangerous chemicals and waste which come from
         land sources and end up in the Ocean. Chemicals such as fertilizers run off from farming lands, 
         often accumulating at the ends of rivers and feeding into the sea. Within these areas, algae grows rapidly,
          blocking out the Sun's rays and consequently starving the water below of oxygen and nutrients, which creates 'dead zones'. 
          Oil spills are hugely harmful to marine life, poisoning animals, fish and plant life and affecting the
          entire food chain as a result. Oil can also cause external damage to creatures such as sharks, clinging onto 
          their bodies and causing irreversible erosion of their fins, scales and other external tissue. This can block marine
          mammal blow holes in creatures such as whales and dolphins, and can lead to hypothermia in furred marine mammals such as otters.
          With sharks being the top of many food chains, this has a huge effect not only on their own survival, but on the eco-system of our Oceans.

    <div class="col-lg-7 threats-content">
      <h2 class="section-title-two">Overfishing</h2>
      <p class="content">Overfishing is the removal of a species of fish from the water,
        faster than their numbers can be replenished. This can result in species becoming scarce,
        underpopulated and consequently threatens their conservation status. It is estimated that
        over one third of fish stocks have been overfished, and will be unlikely to recover if
        humans continue to consume fish and fish products at the rate we currently are.
        The largest change in the population of fish species can have a massive effect on the ecosystem,
        leading to loss of habitat, lack of genetic diversity and unsustainable food sources for both other marine creatures and humans.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-5 threats-image-three" alt="Single Use Plastics"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-7 threats-content">
      <h2 class="section-title-two">Single-Use Plastic</h2>
      <p class="content">Single-use plastics are common all over the world, 
        and they include items we use typically once and throw away, such as plastic bags, 
        bottles and straws. These things, when disposed of, often find their way into the ocean, 
        either through weather, poor waste management or community/government decisions.
        These plastic bags are known as non-biodegradable: taking hundreds of years to break down.
        Larger items can get caught in the sharks' airways and wrapped around their body parts, 
        and smaller items breakdown into microplastics and are consumed by small creatures in the food chain,
        which are then ingested by larger predators and eventually to humans in the fish we eat. 
        This has a huge effect on the shark population as they consume large amounts of prey to survive,
        therefore causing toxins and build up from these microplastics to damage their internal organs and ultimately causing deaths.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-7 threats-content">
      <h2 class="section-title-two">Finning</h2>
      <p class="content">Shark finning is the removal of a shark's fins while they are still alive.
        The fin is used for herbal remedies and as a rare food item, sold by shark finners to make money.
        The shark is then placed back into the ocean without it's fins. The purpose of their fins is
        to assit in movement and stabilitiy, and without them a shark is unable to move or breathe. 
        They quickly suffocate and die in the ocean without their fins. Roughly 70-100 million sharks are
        killed each year for their fins. Finning is a largely unregulated practice, with many endangered 
        species under threat of extinction.
