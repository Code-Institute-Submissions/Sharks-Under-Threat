    <h2 class="page-title-two-black">What can we do to help?</h2>
    <p class="content">Despite the global scale of issues surrounding sharks and their habitat, 
      there are many things we can do to help. The actions of one person alone are not enough; 
      a combined contribution from around the world is the only way we can make a difference and 
      protect the shark population. </p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Reduce your Carbon Footprint</h2>
      <p class="content">The oceans play an important role in balancing the Earth's carbon cycle. 
        As CO2 in the atmosphere increases, it also increases in the oceans, creating Carbonic Acid
        and causing seawater to become more acidic. This acidity leads to corrosion of sharks' teeth and scales,
        compromising their ability to swim, hunt and ultimately survive. Increasing sea water temperatures also
        affect the shark population, as most sharks are cold blooded and therefore unable to survive in certain warmer
        climates. Additionally, the impact of climate change on the ocean's ecosystem directly affects sharks;
        they are unable to find prey in destroying habitats such as bleached corals and barren open oceans,
        leading to starvation and further reducing populations. Reducing our own carbon footprint can help
        reduce these issues, and can be achieved by making small changes in our lifestyle. Using public transport,
        reducing power consumption at home and re-using items such as bags and packaging can all contribute to reducing our carbon footprint.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Eat Less Meat and Fish</h2>
      <p class="content">Meat and fish have become stable items of most people's diets, 
        but the effects of this has a massive impact on our oceans and thus the sharks living in them.
        This waste contains a multitude of chemicals which are omitted into the environment, 
        such as methane, CO2, nitrous oxide and ammonia, all of which are harmful to marine life. 
        Reducing our meat intake would allow for these processes to be vastly reduced, lowering the
        number of chemical pollutants entering the seas and allowing shark populations to recover.
        By reducing our fish intake, we can ensure that their population levels also rise, increasing
        available prey for sharks and other marine life.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Shop Resposibly</h2>
      <p class="content">Shopping responsibly is something we can all do. 
        Buying fewer items in plastic packaging is one example of how we can reduce our consumption
        of single-use plastics, and shopping locally means fewer carbon emissions are released to
        transport goods to us. Choosing recycled packaging also helps to lower the amount of plastics
        in general circulation. 'Fast fashion' is the production of inexpensive clothing, produced
        rapidly by mass-market shops in response to current trends, however, this leads to huge amounts
        of untreated, toxic wastewaters from textile factories being discarded into rivers and seas. 
        Avoiding fast fashion means these pollutants are minimised and the ocean better preserved.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Help Ban Shark Finning</h2>
      <p class="content">Shark finning is still an ongoing problem in various parts of the world,
        and can be combated in a variety of ways. We can ban the sale of shark fins where we live,
        avoid shark fin consumption and sign petitions to increase awareness of this to the wider public.
        By doing this, councils and governments will increase regulations within fishing communities,
        leading to stricter laws and restrictions on fishermen who are drawn to finning sharks. 
        Abolishing shark finning altogether would save millions of sharks a year. </p>
