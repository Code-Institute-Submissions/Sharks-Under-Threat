    <p class="content">After seeing the scale of the problem is hard to see what you as one person can do to help protect sharks world wide but its important to the most that you can. 
      One person can make a diffrence and if everyone gets involved many sharks populations will be able to bounce back and recover meaning less endangered species and
      more bio diversity. </p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Reduce Carbon Footprint</h2>
      <p class="content">he oceans play an important role in keeping the Earth's carbon cycle in balance. As the CO2 in the atmosphere increases more and more is absorbed by the oceans,
        this forms Carbonic Acid which in turn increases the acidity of the oceans. This change in acidity has a massive effect on how many shakrs locate thier prey 
        espeically at night. These effects mean sharks will not be able to find enough food to grow and sustain themselves, this linked with higher sea tempratures will 
        have massive effects on shark poulations and the oceans as a whole. To this end its is important as an indivdual to recduce or own carbon footprint. There are many 
        ways we can do this such as using public transport and bikes more often, using less power in our homes for heating.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Eat Less Meat and Fish</h2>
      <p class="content">Meat and Fish have become staples of many peoples diet but the effects eating both of these has a massive effect on our oceans and creatures that live in them
        even ones we dont often eat such as sharks. The massive land use and run off from animal agriculture pollutes the ocean with fertalisers and animal waste leading
        to the destruction of many of the habitats close to the shore where many sharks rely on thier food. Over fishing also has cause massive dammage to shark numbers with
        a lot less fish in the ocean for them to eat and them often becoming by-catch. By reducing our intake of both meat an fish we can help the fish poulations restore to a
        normal level mean more avaliable for both us and the apex predators of the ocean. By eating less meat we can help to revese some of the dammage that pollution from animal
        agriculture has done to the oceans meaning there are more habitats and food avalible to sharks.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Shop Resposibly</h2>
      <p class="content">Shopping responsbily is one of the most important things we can do to help the oceans and sharks, we as consumers are one of the
        largest creators of the massive ammounts of single use plastics in the oceans. Most items now a days come in plastic packaging 
        this is either for ease of transport or to keep produtcs fresh, this however does not 
       need to happen. Most fruits and vegtables remain fresh for just as long with thier own natural skin to protect them from bacteria
       and going off. Picking products that use recycled
       packaging mean there has been less energy used by remaking the platics rather than making new ones. Also selecting local products
       and ones where the source can be tracked to local
       farmers and providers, reducing the ammount of time these foods have been transported to our shelves. We have to power to chose
       as the consumer and purchasing sustaniable goods
       be it foods or clothes means that large companies will have more incentive to take the time to sustanibaly source their products.
       Its not just about shopping for less plastics
       but also for sustaniable products that have a reduced impact of the enviroment and the oceans.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title-two">Help Ban Shark Finning</h2>
      <p class="content">Shark finning is still a major problem in Asia, Africa and South America where many people rely on this lucrative buisness to feeds thier families. To help combat
        the problem of shark finning there are many things what we can do. Ban the sale of shark fins where we live, sign petitions and bring it to the attention of local goverments.
        By doing this we can increase awareness and education helping to protect more vunrable species. This will also increase regulations by goverment and port authorities, 
        meaning stricter checks on fishing vessels and patrols in local areas and enforcing anti shark finning rules.</p>
